# Achievement 
## Teaching

At Michigan Technological University (MTU), teaching excellence is a priority in Mathematical Sciences. Graduate instructors complete the **Teaching College Mathematics** course before teaching; 3000-level courses are typically assigned to top GTIs with chair approval.

MTU evaluates instruction using the average of **seven dimensions**:

- **Enthusiasm** — instructor enthusiasm for the subject  
- **Clarity** — clear communication of material  
- **Class Engagement** — in-class participation/engagement  
- **Preparation Engagement** — support for out-of-class preparation/reflection  
- **Timely Feedback** — prompt, high-quality feedback  
- **Student Interest** — interest in students’ learning and development  
- **Technology Usage** — effective use of technology

## Summary of Evaluation Scores (All Semesters)

I taught **MA 3710: Engineering Statistics** in multiple modalities: in-person, synchronous online, and asynchronous online. The figures below summarize average evaluation scores by semester and by dimension.

**Interpretation.** The table reports average student evaluation scores for each semester across the seven dimensions. The line plot shows consistently strong evaluations at or above **4.21**, the overall MTU average over the past seven years. The heatmap breaks scores out by dimension (e.g., technology use, participation), highlighting strengths and opportunities for improvement.
