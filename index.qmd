I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.

AS of Fall 2025, this is my 8-th year of teaching Statistics- with gradiate teaching instructor at Michigan Technological University (Fall 2019-Soring 2024), University of Northern Colorado (Fall 2018-Summer 2019), and Visitng assistant Professor at Macalester College (Fall 2025-ongoing). At Macalester, I teach courses across our undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum. 
You can find a complete list of the courses I have taught, and their corresponding course materials, on my [Teaching](teaching/index.qmd) page.  

My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. I develop novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools---and leverage modern machine- and deep-learning approaches---to analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex disease. In collaborative settings, I translate these approaches to address genetic and public-health questions across the biomedical sciences.

I am also developing a strong interest in SoTL (the scholarship of teaching and learning).

Read more about current and past projects on my [Scholarship](research.qmd) page.

I enjoy talking with students about research, graduate programs, and career opportunities in statistics. 
If you are a looking to learn more about opportunities in this field, please get in touch and/or check out the [Resources](resources.qmd) page.

If you're looking to learn more about me, otherwise, take a look at my [CV](cv/cv.pdf) or [About Me](about.qmd) page.
