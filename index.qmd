I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.

At Macalester, I teach courses across our undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum. 
You can find a complete list of the courses I have taught, and their corresponding course materials, on my [Teaching](teaching/index.qmd) page.  

My research focuses on developing and applying statistical methods to answer questions about human health and genetics. 
I am also increasingly interested in Scholarship on Teaching and Learning. 
Read more about current and past projects on my [Scholarship](research.qmd) page.

I enjoy talking with students about research, graduate programs, and career opportunities in (bio)statistics. 
If you are a looking to learn more about opportunities in this field, please get in touch and/or check out the [Resources](resources.qmd) page.

If you're looking to learn more about me, otherwise, take a look at my [CV](cv/cv.pdf) or [About Me](about.qmd) page.
