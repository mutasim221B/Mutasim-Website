Hello! Welcome to my website.

My name is Md Mutasim Billah ([EM-DEE MUTAA-seem bi-LAH](https://namedrop.io/mdmutasimbillah)) and I use the pronouns she/her/hers. 
I am a statistician and Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
I completed my PhD in Statistics at [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/math/) in Summer 2025. Before that, I earned both a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Statistics, Biostatistics, & Informatics from the [University of Dhaka](https://www.stat.du.ac.bd/), the top public university in Bangladesh. I also obtained a second M.Sc. in Statistics from Michigan Technological University.


In my personal life, I am a proud father of three wonderful children -- as of 2025, my daughter is 7 years old, and my two sons are 3 years old and 18 months old. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family and friends or cooking a variety of foods. If you
canâ€™t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on PS5!.
