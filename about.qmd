Hello! Welcome to my website.

My name is Kelsey Grinde ([KELL-see GRIN-dee](https://namedrop.io/kelseygrinde)) and I use the pronouns she/her/hers. 
I am a biostatistician and Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
I was born and raised in the Twin Cities and am happy to back as of Fall 2019.

Before coming to Macalester, I spent five years in Seattle pursuing my PhD in [Biostatistics at the University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/). 
Prior to that, I pursued a BA in mathematics, with a concentration in statistics, at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/). 
I have the wonderful faculty at St. Olaf to thank for inspiring my interest in statistics and teaching at a liberal arts college. 

I can also thank St. Olaf for introducing me to my spouse, Zack, where we met on the intramural soccer field. 
(Coincidentally, my parents also met playing soccer at St. Olaf.) 
I am a lifelong soccer player and fan, and this continues to be one of my favorite ways to spend time outside of work. 
In what's left of my free time, I also enjoy trying new restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops around the Twin Cities, listening to local radio station [The Current](https://www.thecurrent.org/), and traveling. 
The picture on this page is from a February 2024 trip to Fiordland National Park in New Zealand.
