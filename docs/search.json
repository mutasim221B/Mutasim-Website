    "text": "Macalester College — Department of Mathematics, Statistics & Computer Science\nAs part of the Transformation Committee, I contribute across multiple areas that support both faculty and students. I am involved in preceptor hiring, training, and evaluation, with a strong emphasis on creating a sense of community. This includes designing and leading training related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), pedagogy, and departmental policies, as well as serving as a liaison to the Science and Quantitative Center.\nI also focus on faculty support and mentoring by ensuring that junior faculty are paired with senior mentors and that new faculty are connected with colleagues who have previously taught the same course. In addition, I organize reciprocal course visits for all faculty members, encouraging these exchanges to happen early in the academic year.\nWithin the DEI space, I work on updating the department’s DEI website and ensuring that concrete efforts are clearly communicated. I also contribute to rethinking policies and procedures, scheduling student listening sessions, and maintaining community guidelines so they remain relevant and widely shared. To further pedagogical development, I help initiate workshops and working groups tailored to faculty interests, and I collaborate with the Student Advisory Board whenever appropriate."

As Treasurer and later Vice President of the Muslim Student Association (MSA) (Jan 2021–Dec 2022), I oversaw budgeting and financial reporting, submitted funding requests to GSG, coordinated campus partnerships and events, and maintained day-to-day operations and member communications—stepping in for the president when needed to keep initiatives on track.\nEarlier, as President of the Bangladesh Student Association (BSA) (Jan–Dec 2020), I led cultural and community programming, coordinated activities for a broad membership, managed administrative requirements with the university, and represented the organization in collaborations across campus. Together, these roles strengthened my capacity to manage budgets, design inclusive programming, and translate community goals into organized, well-communicated action."

Together, these courses span the foundational and advanced levels of our undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum.\nAt Michigan Technological University (MTU), I served as both a Graduate Teaching Instructor (GTI) and Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for statistics courses. As a GTI, I taught a 3000-level Engineering Statistics course across three modalities: in-person, synchronous online (remote), and asynchronous online.\nAt the University of Northern Colorado (UNCo), I was the GTI for Introduction to Statistical Analysis for three semesters.\nWorking closely with students in and beyond the classroom has deepened my engagement with the scholarship of teaching and learning. I’ve participated in several teaching conferences and workshops that strengthened my understanding of evidence-based pedagogy, inclusive course design, and equitable assessment—especially alternative/specifications grading and transparent assignment design. I continue to develop my practice around active-learning strategies, support for diverse learners, and the thoughtful use of learning analytics to improve engagement and outcomes.

I am a statistician and Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I completed my PhD in Statistics at Michigan Technological University in Summer 2025. Before that, I earned both a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Statistics, Biostatistics, & Informatics from the University of Dhaka, the top public university in Bangladesh. I also obtained a second M.Sc. in Statistics from Michigan Technological University.\nIn my personal life, I am a proud father of three wonderful children – as of 2025, my daughter is 7 years old, and my two sons are 3 years old and 18 months old. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family and friends or cooking a variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on PS5!\nThe picture on this page is from a July 2024 trip to Pictured Rocks at Munising, Michigan."
