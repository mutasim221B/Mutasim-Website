I contributed some reflections and tips on applying for jobs at liberal arts colleges, and there is also great advice from others on applying for other types of jobs.\nCheck out this dataset containing salary ranges for statistics faculty positions. I created, and regularly update, this dataset by pulling salary ranges listed on official job postings shared via the ASA Community Job Postings Site, IsoStat mailing list, etc. As it becomes more common (or even required) for institutions to list salary ranges on job postings, I hope to be able to expand this resource even further!"

    "text": "Hello! Welcome to my website.\nMy name is Kelsey Grinde (KELL-see GRIN-dee) and I use the pronouns she/her/hers. I am a biostatistician and Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I was born and raised in the Twin Cities and am happy to back as of Fall 2019.\nBefore coming to Macalester, I spent five years in Seattle pursuing my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. Prior to that, I pursued a BA in mathematics, with a concentration in statistics, at St. Olaf College. I have the wonderful faculty at St. Olaf to thank for inspiring my interest in statistics and teaching at a liberal arts college.\nI can also thank St. Olaf for introducing me to my spouse, Zack, where we met on the intramural soccer field. (Coincidentally, my parents also met playing soccer at St. Olaf.) I am a lifelong soccer player and fan, and this continues to be one of my favorite ways to spend time outside of work. In what’s left of my free time, I also enjoy trying new restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops around the Twin Cities, listening to local radio station The Current, and traveling. The picture on this page is from a February 2024 trip to Fiordland National Park in New Zealand."

    "text": "I am a biostatistician and statistical geneticist with scholarly interests in both statistical methods development and collaborative applications. My work focuses on developing and applying statistical methods to better understand human health and genetics, with a recent emphasis on genetic studies in populations with mixed ancestry (also known as “admixed populations”). Methodologically, I am particularly interested in addressing the statistical challenges posed by genetic data, such as their high dimensional nature, complicated correlation structure, and concerns about confounding and collider bias that can arise in these studies.\nAs a teacher-scholar at a small liberal arts institution, I engage undergraduates in this work through summer research projects, honors theses, and a newly designed course in statistical genetics. My close collaboration with students within and beyond the classroom has also inspired an increasing engagement in the scholarship of teaching and learning, with a focus thus far on alternative grading."
