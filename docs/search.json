I contributed some reflections and tips on applying for jobs at liberal arts colleges, and there is also great advice from others on applying for other types of jobs.\nCheck out this dataset containing salary ranges for statistics faculty positions. I created, and regularly update, this dataset by pulling salary ranges listed on official job postings shared via the ASA Community Job Postings Site, IsoStat mailing list, etc. As it becomes more common (or even required) for institutions to list salary ranges on job postings, I hope to be able to expand this resource even further!"

    "text": "Hello! Welcome to my website.\nMy name is Md Mutasim Billah (EM-DEE MUTAA-seem bi-LAH) and I use the pronouns she/her/hers. I am a statistician and Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I completed my PhD in Statistics at Michigan Technological University in Summer 2025. Before that, I earned both a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Statistics, Biostatistics, & Informatics from the University of Dhaka, the top public university in Bangladesh. I also obtained a second M.Sc. in Statistics from Michigan Technological University.\nIn my personal life, I am a proud father of three wonderful children – as of 2025, my daughter is 7 years old, and my two sons are 3 years old and 18 months old. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family and friends or cooking a variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on PS5!.\nThe picture on this page is from a Juky 2024 trip to Pictured Rocks at Munising, Michigan."

    "text": "I am a biostatistician and statistical geneticist with scholarly interests in both statistical methods development and collaborative applications. My work focuses on developing and applying statistical methods to better understand human health and genetics, with a recent emphasis on genetic studies in populations with mixed ancestry (also known as “admixed populations”). Methodologically, I am particularly interested in addressing the statistical challenges posed by genetic data, such as their high dimensional nature, complicated correlation structure, and concerns about confounding and collider bias that can arise in these studies.\nAs a teacher-scholar at a small liberal arts institution, I engage undergraduates in this work through summer research projects, honors theses, and a newly designed course in statistical genetics. My close collaboration with students within and beyond the classroom has also inspired an increasing engagement in the scholarship of teaching and learning, with a focus thus far on alternative grading."

You can find a complete list of the courses I have taught, and their corresponding course materials, on my Teaching page.\nMy methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. I develop novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools—and leverage modern machine- and deep-learning approaches—to analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex disease. In collaborative settings, I translate these approaches to address genetic and public-health questions across the biomedical sciences.\nI am also developing a strong interest in SoTL (the scholarship of teaching and learning).\nRead more about current and past projects on my Scholarship page.\nI enjoy talking with students about research, graduate programs, and career opportunities in statistics. If you are a looking to learn more about opportunities in this field, please get in touch and/or check out the Resources page.\nIf you’re looking to learn more about me, otherwise, take a look at my CV or About Me page."
