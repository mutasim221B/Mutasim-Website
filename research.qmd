## Overview 

I am a biostatistician and statistical geneticist with scholarly interests in both statistical methods development and collaborative applications. 
My work focuses on developing and applying statistical methods to better understand human health and genetics, with a recent emphasis on genetic studies in populations with mixed ancestry (also known as "admixed populations"). 
Methodologically, I am particularly interested in addressing the statistical challenges posed by genetic data, such as their high dimensional nature, complicated correlation structure, and concerns about confounding and collider bias that can arise in these studies. 

As a teacher-scholar at a small liberal arts institution, I engage undergraduates in this work through summer research projects, honors theses, and a newly designed [course in statistical genetics](https://mac-stat.github.io/statgen/). 
My close collaboration with students within and beyond the classroom has also inspired an increasing engagement in the scholarship of teaching and learning, with a focus thus far on alternative grading.

<!--
My primary research interests are in the areas of biostatistics and statistical genetics. Most recently, my work has focused on developing and applying statistical methods for genetic studies in admixed populations---populations with mixed and diverse ancestry such as African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos---who have been [vastly underrepresented](https://www.nature.com/articles/538161a) in genetics research to date. 
For example, one of my recent projects developed methods and a corresponding [R package](https://github.com/GrindeLab/STEAM) (the latter of which has ongoing involved collaboration with Macalester students) for controlling for multiple testing in genome-wide admixture mapping studies. 

Methodologically, I am particularly interested in addressing the statistical challenges posed by genetic data, such as their high dimensional nature, complicated correlation structure, and concerns about confounding and collider bias that can arise in these studies. 
In general, I strive to ensure that my applied and methodological work is grounded in a deep understanding of the context (scientific, ethical, etc.) surrounding the data with which I am working. 
This often involves close collaboration with experts in other disciplines and, whenever possible, undergraduate students.
