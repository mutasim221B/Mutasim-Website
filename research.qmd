## Overview 

I am a statistician and statistical geneticist with scholarly interests in both statistical methods development and collaborative applications. My work focuses on developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools—leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches—to analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data and identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex disease. 

I plan to engage students in this work by developing new courses (e.g., Statistical Genetics), integrating dataset-driven in-class projects, and supervising independent studies, honors theses, and—where appropriate—MS/PhD dissertations. Students will gain experience in R/Python, reproducible workflows (Quarto/Git), and scalable computing, and will be encouraged to disseminate their findings through campus research symposia, undergraduate research showcases, and regional/national conferences.


## Past Projects
Below are the lists of past projects- manuscripts are in preparation.

- TWAS-CTL: A robust and efficient framework in multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies using cross-tissue learner

- GBoost-CTL: A novel method in multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies in cross-tissue learner incorporating GWAS information

- Application of Deep Learning and Boosted Tree Methods in multi-tissue TWAS framework

## Active Research

- Extending multi-tissue TWAS frameworks (e.g., CTL, G-Boost-CTL) to leverage GWAS summary-level data 
- Benchmarking advanced ML and DL Models for cross-tissue gene expression imputation 
- Developing unsupervised clustering and latent-factor approaches to characterize pleiotropic effects in GWAS
- Investigating the distinct roles and interactions of local and distant genetic variants in controlling gene expression across different tissues within the TWAS framework
- Applying advanced ML and DL architectures for multi-omics data integration
- Developing sparsity-inducing, power-adaptive procedures to identify and remove non-informative tissues in multi-tissue TWAS
