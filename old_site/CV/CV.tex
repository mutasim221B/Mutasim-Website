%	All analyses are complete and a draft of the manuscript has been approved by my co-authors. 
%	The paper uses data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) studies, both of which require that manuscripts be submitted to their publications committee prior to journal submission. Our paper is currently under review by the WHI publications committee and will be submitted to TOPMed shortly.
