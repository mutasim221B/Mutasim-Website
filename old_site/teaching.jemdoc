At Macalester, I teach classes ranging across all levels of our undergraduate statistics curriculum, from introductory statistics to upper-level statistical theory. I'm excited to be introducing a new course in Statistical Genetics coming Fall 2022. Before coming to Macalester, I was lead instructor or teaching assistant for various undergraduate and graduate biostatistics courses at the University of Washington.
