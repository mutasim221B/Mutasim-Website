At Macalester College, I am currently teaching Introduction to Statistical Modeling and am scheduled to teach Statistical Machine Learning in the Spring 2026. These courses represent both the foundational and advanced levels of the undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum.

The materials for each course are provided in the table below.

Before joining Macalester, I spent seven years as an instructor and teaching assistant for a variety of undergraduate and graduate statistics courses at Michigan Technological University and the University of Northern Colorado.

More details about the latter are available on my [CV](../cv/cv.pdf).

<!-- reorganize to include syllabi from all semesters? -->
