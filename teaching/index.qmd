At Macalester, I teach classes ranging across all levels of our undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum, from introductory statistics to a capstone course in statistical genetics. 
Materials for each of these courses are provided in the table below.

Before coming to Macalester, I was an instructor and teaching assistant for various undergraduate and graduate biostatistics courses at the University of Washington. 
More details about the latter are available on my [CV](../cv/cv.pdf).

<!-- reorganize to include syllabi from all semesters? -->
